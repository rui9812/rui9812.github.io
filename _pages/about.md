<h2>🧑‍🎓 About Me</h2>
My name is Rui Li. I am currently a second-year PhD candidate in Renmin University of China, supervised by [Prof. Xu Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=loPoqy0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). Before embarking on my PhD journey, I received my BSc and MSc degrees in Computer Science at Dalian University of Technology, under the guidance of [Prof. Yanming Shen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MvlgpWcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). My current research mainly focuses on Self-Evolving LLM Agents and Retrieval-Augmented Generation. I also maintain a strong interest in Graph Neural Networks and Knowledge Graphs, particularly their interaction with LLM systems.

<h2>🧑‍💻 Internship Experience</h2>

- **Huawei Noah's Ark Lab** (Aug. 2024 – Feb. 2025)  
  Conducted research on LLM agentic memory and self-bootstrapping retrieval-augmented generation.

- **Microsoft Research Asia** (Oct. 2021 – Feb. 2023)  
  Worked on knowledge representation learning, and explored joint training of GNNs and LMs.

💡 I am currently exploring internship opportunities related to **Self-Evolving LLM (Multi-)Agent Systems**. Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in my research or background.
